            <p>Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create
                layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a proper look at the
                CSS Box Model so that you can build more complex layout tasks with an understanding of how it works and
                the terminology that relates to it.</p>
            <h2>What is a CSS box model?</h2>
            <p>The full CSS box model applies to block boxes, inline boxes only use some of the behavior defined in the
                box model. The model defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content —
                work together to create a box that you can see on the page. To add some additional complexity, there is
                a standard and an alternate box model.</p>
            <h2>Parts of a box</h2>
            <p>Making up a block box in CSS we have the: <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Content box: The area where your content is displayed, which can be sized using properties like
                        width and height.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; its size can be controlled
                        using padding and related properties.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding. Its size and style can be
                        controlled using border and related properties.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding and border as
                        whitespace between this box and other elements. Its size can be controlled using margin and
                        related properties.
                    </li><br>
                </ul>
